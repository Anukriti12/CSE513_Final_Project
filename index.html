            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Creating art is a fundamental part of childhood, valued by both children and parents as a means to connect and bond over their children’s artistic expressions. For parents who are blind or have low vision (BLV), engaging with their sighted children’s artwork poses unique challenges. Traditional methods of interacting with visual art rely heavily on sight, which can make it difficult for BLV parents to fully appreciate and discuss their children’s creations. This gap in engagement can impact the emotional connection and understanding between parents and their children.</p>
            <p>Our project aims to address this challenge by developing an iOS app that uses AI-generated descriptions to help BLV parents engage with their children’s artwork. The app leverages ChatGPT to create detailed descriptions from pictures of children’s artwork, which parents can then explore using voiceover and high-contrast settings. This tool not only facilitates a deeper understanding of the artwork but also enables BLV parents to have meaningful conversations with their children about their creations.</p>
            <p>By incorporating feedback from formative research with BLV parents and their children, our app is designed to meet the specific needs of mixed visual ability families. The inclusion of a human-in-the-loop system allows children and parents to edit the AI-generated descriptions, ensuring accuracy and personal relevance. This project represents a significant step towards making children’s artwork more accessible and fostering stronger family connections.</p>

            <h2>Positive Disability Principles</h2>
            <h3>Leadership of Those Most Impacted</h3>
            <p>From the outset, our project has involved BLV parents and their children in the design process. Their insights and feedback have been crucial in shaping the app’s features and functionalities. By centering the voices of those most impacted, we ensure that our solution addresses real needs and preferences.</p>
            <h3>Recognizing Wholeness</h3>
            <p>While much accessibility research focuses on productivity tools, our project acknowledges the importance of leisure and familial activities in the lives of BLV individuals. Recognizing that everyone’s life encompasses more than just work, we aim to enhance the personal and emotional connections between parents and children through art.</p>
            <h3>Interdependence</h3>
            <p>Our formative work highlights the interdependent nature of family interactions around artwork. The app is designed to support both BLV parents and their children, facilitating a collaborative approach to understanding and discussing art. This principle is embodied in the human-in-the-loop system, where children contribute to refining AI-generated descriptions.</p>

        <section id="methodology-and-results">
            <h2>Methodology and Results</h2>
            <h3>Project Design</h3>
            <p>We designed an iOS app that uses ChatGPT to generate descriptions from pictures of children's artwork. The app includes features like voiceover compatibility, high-contrast visual settings, and an intuitive navigation system to ensure accessibility for BLV users.</p>
            <h3>Implementation</h3>
            <p>Our development process involved several key steps:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Finalizing design prompts to ensure comprehensive and accurate artwork descriptions.</li>
                <li>Building the app's core functionality to process images and generate descriptions using ChatGPT.</li>
                <li>Integrating accessibility features such as voiceover support and high-contrast mode.</li>
                <li>Implementing a human-in-the-loop system for users to edit AI-generated descriptions.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Metrics for Success</h3>
            <p>We measured the app’s success using several metrics:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Usability</strong>: Evaluated through user testing sessions with BLV parents.</li>
                <li><strong>Accuracy</strong>: Assessed by comparing AI-generated descriptions with those provided by sighted individuals.</li>
                <li><strong>Engagement</strong>: Measured by the frequency and quality of interactions between parents and children facilitated by the app.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Validation</h3>
            <p>To validate our app, we conducted user testing sessions with BLV parents and their children. Participants provided feedback on the usability and accuracy of the AI-generated descriptions. We also measured the increase in parent-child interactions related to artwork.</p>
