        <section id="introduction">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Creating art is a fundamental part of childhood, cherished by both children and parents as a means to connect and bond over their children’s artistic expressions. For children, creating art is a way to express their emotions, imagination, and experiences. For parents, viewing and discussing their children's artwork is a way to understand their child's world, encourage their creativity, and foster emotional connections.
            </p>
            <p>However, for parents who are blind or have low vision (BLV), engaging with their sighted children’s artwork poses unique challenges. Traditional methods of interacting with visual art rely heavily on sight, which can make it difficult for BLV parents to fully appreciate and discuss their children’s creations. This gap in engagement can impact the emotional connection and understanding between parents and their children, potentially affecting the child’s confidence and the parent-child relationship.</p>
            <p>Our project aims to address this challenge by developing an iOS app that uses AI-generated descriptions to help BLV parents engage with their children’s artwork. The app leverages advanced GPT-APIs to create detailed, vivid descriptions from pictures of children’s artwork (some examples are shown in <a href="#figure-artworks">Figure 1</a>), which parents can then explore using voiceover, high-contrast, and magnification settings. This tool not only facilitates self-exploration of the artwork but also enables BLV parents to have meaningful conversations with their children about their creations, thus bridging the gap caused by visual impairment. By incorporating feedback from formative research with BLV parents and their children, our app is designed to meet the specific needs of mixed visual ability families. The inclusion of a human-in-the-loop system allows children and parents to edit the AI-generated descriptions, ensuring accuracy and personal relevance. This collaborative approach not only improves the quality of the descriptions but also empowers both parents and children to contribute to the understanding and appreciation of the artwork. By ensuring that BLV parents can actively engage with and discuss their children’s artistic expressions, we aim to enhance the emotional bonds within mixed-ability families and support the developmental growth of children through positive reinforcement and shared experiences.</p>
            <p>In addition to addressing the immediate needs of BLV parents, our app also contributes to the broader goals of accessibility and inclusion. By demonstrating how technology can be used to create inclusive experiences, we hope to inspire further innovations that support diverse needs and promote equity in family interactions and beyond. With this project, we envision a future where all parents, regardless of their visual abilities, can fully participate in their children’s creative journeys, fostering a more inclusive and understanding world for everyone.</p>

            <h2>Positive Disability Principles</h2>
            <p><strong>1. </strong>Our project is not ableist and aims to make children’s artwork more accessible to BLV parents. The formative work guiding this project ensures that our technology solution is not a “disability dongle”.</p>
            <p><strong>2. </strong>BLV family members and their children have guided this work, primarily through the findings from formative studies as previously mentioned. In the future, we hope to co-design and evaluate any technology outputs of this work with mixed visual ability families.</p>
            <p><strong>3. </strong>Our project aims to improve the agency of people with disabilities by providing BLV parents a supplemental understanding of their children’s artwork which they can use to further engagements with their children.</p>
            <p><strong>4. </strong>While we are not addressing multiple disabled people (such as deafblind individuals) through this work, as that would require more formative understanding, we have consulted with multiple different BLV individuals and their children. Additionally, the formative work has looked at a wide range of relative-child relationships: parent-child, grandparent-grandchild, great-grandparent-great-grandchild, aunt/uncle-niece/nephew. This ensures that our solutions work not only for BLV parents and their children but also for other BLV-sighted family relationships.</p>
            <p><strong>5. </strong>All technology produced through this work is accessible to BLV individuals. We tested our app with VoiceOver and other accessibility settings like magnification and high-contrast. We have also avoided cognitively overloaded designs, and used plain language wherever possible in our application. We used standard digital design tools such as PowerPoint or Figma, which have been audited and tested for accessibility, during our design phase.</p>

        <section id="related-work">
            <h2>Related Work</h2>
            <p>Several projects and studies have informed our approach to making children’s artwork accessible to BLV parents.</p>
            <h3>User-Centered Design in Accessibility</h3>
            <p>User-centered design principles are crucial in accessibility projects. Previous studies emphasize the importance of involving end-users in the design process to create solutions that truly meet their needs. Hence, the research mentioned above has been conducted with BLV parents and children, ensuring that the app is both usable and valuable in the mixed-ability settings.</p>
            <h3>AI-Generated Descriptions</h3>
            <p>Previous work has explored the use of AI to generate descriptions for visual content. Projects like Microsoft's Seeing AI and Google's Lookout provide insights into the capabilities and limitations of AI in generating useful descriptions for visually impaired users.</p>
            <h3>Technology in Mixed-Ability Family Interactions</h3>
            <p>Prior research in mixed-ability family settings includes work by <a href="#formative-research1">[1]</a> and <a href="#formative-research2">[2]</a>, who explore the design of technology for co-reading interactions between BLV parents and their children, approaching the BLV parent's perspective through observational and interview studies like we do in our work. However, prior research has not investigated technology facilitating a mixed visual-ability family's interaction regarding children's artwork.</p>
            <h3>Formative Work [In Submission]</h3>
            <p>A member of our team led formative work that is in submission <a href="#formative-research3">[3]</a> to investigate what motivates BLV relatives to engage with their children’s artwork, current practices by BLV relatives and their children to discuss and adapt the child’s artwork, BLV adults and sighted children’s reactions to AI interpretations of the child’s artwork, and the families’ collective responses to the technology design probes. These research questions were explored through two studies: the first was with 14 BLV individuals, and the second study was with 5 BLV relative and sighted children groups. These studies consisted of semi-structured interviews, using two different AI tools to describe children’s artwork (provided by the BLV family members), and two in-person design probes to evaluate preferred technology representation mediums for nonvisual understanding of children’s artwork. Through these studies, researchers found that BLV family members are motivated by a desire to emotionally connect and bond with their child, as well as a need to understand their child’s developmental growth and skills. While many BLV individuals found some benefits to AI descriptions, saying that some information was better than none and it enabled them to have a conversation or ask questions to their children, some parents did not like it when the AI used simplistic or reductive language to explain their child’s art. These findings specifically around the role and language of AI have heavily informed this present work.</p>

        <section id="methodology-and-results">
            <h2>Methodology and Evaluation</h2>
            <h3>Project Design</h3>
            <p>We designed an iOS app that uses ChatGPT to generate detailed descriptions from pictures of children's artwork. The app includes essential accessibility features such as voiceover compatibility, high-contrast visual settings, and an intuitive navigation system to ensure ease of use for BLV users. The design process was iterative, involving multiple rounds of feedback from BLV parents and their children to ensure the app met their specific needs.</p>
            <h3>Implementation</h3>
            <p>Our major contributions in the final project include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Finalizing Designs</strong>: We completed the designs for our app, including detailed interaction flows for users. This involved creating wireframes and prototypes using accessible digital design tools like Figma, which were audited for accessibility (Shown in <a href="#figure-designs">Figure 2</a>).</li>
                <li><strong>Prompt Engineering</strong>: We performed extensive prompt engineering to ensure comprehensive and accurate artwork descriptions. We validated the relevance of the prompt by comparing outputs from a custom GPT model (ArtInsight) and GPT-4o.</li>
                <p>Final Prompt:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>"This assistant helps blind parents understand their childrens visual artwork. It provides detailed, respectful descriptions of the artwork, focusing on descriptive aspects such as orientation, scenery, number of artifacts or figures, main colors, and themes. The assistant avoids reductive or overly simplifying language that minimizes the childs effort and does not assume interpretations if uncertain. For example, it says, ‘The person has a frown, and there are tears falling from their eyes’ instead of ‘The person appears to be sad.’ When given feedback from the parent or child about the artwork, the assistant honors and integrates this perspective into its descriptions and future responses. The assistant maintains a respectful, supportive, and engaging tone, encouraging open dialogue about the artwork. This assistant uses a casual tone but will switch to a more formal tone if requested by the parent or child. The assistant avoids making assumptions about names or identities based on any text in the artwork."</p>
                </blockquote>
                <li><strong>Core functionality</strong>: We built the core functionality of the app to process images and generate descriptions using ChatGPT. This included integrating with the iPhone camera and third-party libraries to upload images and process them (<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IIV68pUCShIby07sAVK6CLpHyGJWEWYf/view?resourcekey">Click here for app demo</a>).</li>
                <li><strong>Voice Memo Integration</strong>: We incorporated a UI feature that allows children to record voice memos describing their artwork, which can be saved and reviewed by BLV parents (The UI of our app is shown in <a href="#figure-app-ui">Figure 3</a>).</li>
                <li><strong>Human-in-the-loop system</strong>: Although out of scope for the current phase, we plan to implement a system that allows users to edit AI-generated descriptions, ensuring they are accurate and personally relevant.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Salient Features of the iOS app</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Integrates with iOS accessibility settings (success criterion)</li>
                <li>Additional, custom VoiceOver and dynamic-type support (success criterion) - It is an iOS / MacOS feature which automatically scales text according to user preference (includes large, accessible fonts)</li>
                <li>Integrates with iPhone camera via third-party library</li>

            </ul>
    
            <h3>Metrics and Validation</h3>
            <p>These are some metrics for success that we considered:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>VoiceOver Compatibility</strong>: We conducted manual tests to ensure that all interactive elements are correctly labeled and accessible via VoiceOver.</li>
                <li><strong>Contrast Ratio</strong>: We verified that the app meets the minimum contrast ratio requirements (4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text) as per the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).</li>
                <li><strong>Error Handling</strong>: We tested the app for robustness by inputting various types of images, including very complex, very simple, or irrelevant images, and ensure that the app handles errors gracefully without crashing.</li>
                <li><strong>AI Descriptions Match Formative Work Guidelines</strong>: We validated that our custom GPT described all elements of the artwork in appropriate language, and was not reductive, simplistic, and presumptive.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Success Criteria for AI Descriptions</h4>
            <p>We evaluated the AI descriptions of 10 different artworks created by children using GPT-4o and our custom GPT (ArtInsight). We measured the number of elements identified, usage of reductive language, simplistic descriptions, and presumptive statements.</p>
            <p>Performance Comparison:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Art Insight performed better than GPT 4o on 6/10 different drawings.</li>
                <li>GPT 4o performed better than Art Insgight on 1/10 drawings.</li>
                <li>Both (Art Insight and GPT 4o) had equal performance on 3/10 drawings.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These metrics and validation steps ensured that our app met the necessary accessibility standards and provided meaningful, accurate descriptions of children’s artwork.</p>

            <p>These are some other metrics for success (Out of Scope):</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Usability</strong>: We plan to evaluate our app through user testing sessions with BLV parents.</li>
                <li><strong>Accuracy</strong>: We plan to compare AI-generated descriptions with a set of reference descriptions created by sighted individuals.</li>
                <li><strong>Engagement</strong>: We plan to measure the frequency and quality of interactions between parents and children facilitated by the app.</li>
